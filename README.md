# Login-System-PHP-MySql
This is a Login + Registration System in PHP. I have used bootstrap as a CSS framework to minimize the frontend work.

It contains 4 main files:

-login.php.

-logout.php.

-signup.php.

-welcome.php.

The Partials folder contains the code for Database connection as well as the Navigation bar.

You can use XAMP as it contains all the neccessary files for setting up code environment for PHP as well as the database connection.
